# ElectronicsDB_XML

As a data engineer specializing in XML, my primary focus revolves around parsing, querying, and transforming XML data using XPath and XQuery. Within our group assignment, I've taken on the responsibility of extracting and structuring data to facilitate further analysis.                                                 
To begin our data processing journey, I've utilized the BaseX application to import the 'electronicsdb.xml' file.
